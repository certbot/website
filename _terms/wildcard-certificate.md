A wildcard certificate is a certificate that contains one or more hostnames starting with “*.”. A client (e.g. a webbrowser) will accept any (valid DNS) label in place of the asterisk (“*”). For example, a certificate for “*.example.com” will be valid for “www.example.com”, “mail.example.com”, “hello.example.com”, or “goodbye.example.com”. However, it will not be valid for “example.com”: the label of the asterisk can not be empty. If you want the certificate to be valid for “example.com” too, you will need to add the hostname “example.com” and the wildcard hostname “*.example.com” to the same certificate. Also, the asterisk can only be substituted by a single label and not multiple labels. For example, the hostname “hello.goodbye.example.com” will not be covered by a certificate containing “*.example.com”. It will be covered however, by a certificate containing “*.goodbye.example.com”. Also note that a wildcard certificate can not contain multiple asterisks. For example, a certificate containing “*.*.example.com” is not valid and will not be issued by Let's Encrypt.
