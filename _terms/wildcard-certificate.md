A wildcard certificate is a certificate that covers one or more names starting with *. and that will be accepted by a web browser for any subdomain name with any label in place of the * character. For example, a certificate for *.example.com will be valid for www.example.com, mail.example.com, hello.example.com, or goodbye.example.com, but not for example.com.
