This website provides information about the level of support for various web servers and operating systems, which varies and is increasing over time. On supported systems, the automated configuration makes it fast and easy to obtain, install, and automatically renew certificates.

If automated configuration is not supported for your web server, you can still get a certificate using Certbot and configure your server software manually. In this case, the certificate will not be renewed automatically.

Note that automated configuration is not required. It can be disabled if you prefer to configure your server software yourself.
