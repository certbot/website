Since it doesn't seem like your operating system has a packaged version of Certbot, you should use our certbot-auto script to get a copy:
</p>
<pre>wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto
sudo mv certbot-auto /usr/local/bin/certbot-auto
sudo chown root:root /usr/local/bin/certbot-auto
sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/certbot-auto</pre>
<p>
<tt>certbot-auto</tt> accepts the same flags as <tt>certbot</tt>; it
{{#advanced}}is a wrapper that{{/advanced}} installs all of its own
dependencies and updates the client code automatically.

    <h4>Note:</h4>
  <p><tt>certbot-auto</tt> will always try to fetch the newest version of
  itself from its most recent release. If you want it to be locked to a
  specific version and not receive automatic updates, run it with the
  <tt>--no-self-upgrade</tt> flag. Also, if you're nervous about downloading and
  running scripts from the network, some <a

  steps</a> are available.
