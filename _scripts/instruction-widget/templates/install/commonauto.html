<h4>Note for existing Debian 8 Certbot users</h4>
<p>
<em>NOTE</em>: We previously suggested using the operating system-provided packaged version of Certbot on Debian 8 (jessie). Because of important updates in the Certbot code, we are now recommending that Debian 8 users switch to the <tt>certbot-auto</tt> method, described below.</p>
<p>
If this is your first time installing Certbot on your Debian 8 system, you do not need to do anything else before installing <tt>certbot-auto</tt>. But if you've previously installed Certbot via <tt>apt-get</tt> on your Debian 8 system, we recommend uninstalling the packaged version before continuing with the other steps below, in order to avoid potential conflicts between the two versions. You can do this with
</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get remove certbot</pre>
<p>
If you don't remember whether or not you've installed the packaged version of Certbot, there is no harm in running this command; if the packaged version of Certbot isn't installed on your system, the command has no effect. Uninstalling the packaged version of Certbot does not delete your existing certificates, if any.
</p>
<h4>Installing certbot-auto on your system</h4>
{{/jessie}}
<p>
Since it doesn't seem like your operating system has a{{#jessie}}n up-to-date{{/jessie}} packaged version of Certbot, you should{{#jessie}} remove any previously installed packaged version, if applicable, and then{{/jessie}} use our certbot-auto script to get a{{#jessie}}n up-to-date{{/jessie}} copy:
</p>
<pre>wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto
sudo mv certbot-auto /usr/local/bin/certbot-auto
sudo chown root /usr/local/bin/certbot-auto
sudo chmod 0755 /usr/local/bin/certbot-auto</pre>
<p>
<tt>certbot-auto</tt> accepts the same flags as <tt>certbot</tt>; it
{{#advanced}}is a wrapper that{{/advanced}} installs all of its own
dependencies and updates the client code automatically.

    <h4>Note:</h4>
  <p><tt>certbot-auto</tt> will always try to fetch the newest version of
  itself from its most recent release. If you want it to be locked to a
  specific version and not receive automatic updates, run it with the
  <tt>--no-self-upgrade</tt> flag. Also, if you're nervous about downloading and
  running scripts from the network, some <a

  steps</a> are available.
