    <h3>Snap Support</h3>

  <p>
  Certbot snap support is currently in its beta phase and only supports the

  using snap by selecting your OS in the dropdown above.

<li>
    Install snapd
    <p>
    You'll need to install snapd and make sure you follow any instructions to enable classic snap support.<br>
    Follow these instructions on <a href='https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd/'>snapcraft's site to install snapd</a>.

</li>
<li>
    Remove any Certbot OS packages
    <p>
    If you have any Certbot packages installed using an OS package manager like
    <tt>apt</tt>, <tt>dnf</tt>, or <tt>yum</tt>, you should remove them before
    installing the Certbot snap to ensure that when you run the command
    <tt>certbot</tt> the snap is used rather than the installation from your OS
    package manager. The exact command to do this depends on your OS, but
    common examples are <tt>sudo apt-get remove certbot</tt>, <tt>sudo dnf
    remove certbot</tt>, or <tt>sudo yum remove certbot</tt>.
