<h3>Automating renewal</h3>

{{^cron_included}}
  <p>
    Certbot can be configured to renew your certificates automatically before they
    expire. Since Let's Encrypt certificates last for 90 days, it's highly
    advisable to take advantage of this feature. You can test automatic renewal for
    your certificates by running this command:
  </p>
{{/cron_included}}
{{#cron_included}}
  <p>
    The version of certbot packaged for your system comes with a {{cron_info}} to
    handle automatic renewal. This means that certbot will renew any certificates
    that you generate with it automatically when they are within 30 days of expiry.
    You can find more information about <a
      href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewal">renewals</a> and <a
      href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#automated-renewals">automated renewals</a>
    in the full certbot documentation.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you would like to test manually to see that renewal will work, you can run
    this command:
  </p>
{{/cron_included}}

<pre>
$ sudo {{base_command}} renew --dry-run
</pre>

{{^cron_included}}
  If that appears to be working correctly, you can arrange for automatic renewal
  by adding a <tt><a href="http://www.unixgeeks.org/security/newbie/unix/cron-1.html">cron job</a></tt> or <tt><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd/Timers">systemd timer</a></tt> which runs the
  following:<br>

  <pre>{{base_command}} renew</pre>

  <aside class="note">
      <h4>Note:</h4>
      <p>if you're setting up a <tt>cron</tt> or <tt>systemd</tt> job, we
    recommend running it twice per day (it won't do anything until your
    certificates are due for renewal or revoked, but running it regularly would
    give your site a chance of staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated
    revocation happened for some reason). Please select a random minute within the
    hour for your renewal tasks.</p>
  </aside>

  <p>An example cron job might look like this, which will run at noon and midnight every day:</p>

  <pre>0 0,12 * * * python -c 'import random; import time; time.sleep(random.random() * 3600)' && {{base_command}} renew {{#cbauto}}--no-self-upgrade{{/cbauto}}</pre>
