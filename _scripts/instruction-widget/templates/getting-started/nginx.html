<p>
Certbot has an Nginx plugin, which is supported on
many platforms, and certificate installation.
</p>
<pre>$ sudo {{base_command}} --nginx</pre>
<p>
Running this command will get a certificate for you and have Certbot edit your Nginx configuration
automatically to serve it. If you're feeling more conservative and would like to make the changes to your
Nginx configuration by hand, you can use the <tt>certonly</tt>
subcommand:
<pre>$ sudo {{base_command}} --nginx certonly</pre>

        <h4>Note:</h4>
        <p>the Nginx plugin with <tt>certonly</tt> does the following:<br>
        <ol>
          <li>make temporary config changes<br>
          (adding a new server block to pass an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-acme-acme-02#section-7.3">ACME Challenge</a>)</li>
          <li>performs a graceful reload</li>
          <li>reverts all changes</li>
          <li>performs another graceful reload</li>
        </ol>
        This appears to be a reliable process, but if you don't want Certbot
        to touch your Nginx process or files in any way, you can use the
        <a
        href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#webroot">webroot
        plugin</a> instead.

<strong>If you want to obtain a wildcard certificate using Let's Encrypt's new ACMEv2
server, you'll also need to use one of
<a href="/docs/using.html#dns-plugins">Certbot's DNS plugins</a>.</strong> To do this,
make sure the plugin for your DNS provider is installed using the instructions
above and run a command like the following:
</p>
<pre>$ sudo {{base_command}} -a dns-plugin -i nginx -d "*.example.com" -d example.com --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory</pre>
<p>
You'll need to replace <tt>dns-plugin</tt> with the name of the DNS plugin
you want to use. You may also need to provide additional flags such as the path
your API credentials as described in the documentation for the DNS plugin
linked above.
