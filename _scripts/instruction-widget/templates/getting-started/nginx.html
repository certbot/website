<p>
Certbot has an Nginx plugin, which is supported on
many platforms, and automates both obtaining and installing certs:
</p>
<pre>$ {{base_command}} --nginx</pre>
<p>
Running this command will get a certificate for you and have Certbot edit your Nginx configuration
automatically to serve it. If you're feeling more conservative and would like to make the changes to your
Nginx configuration by hand, you can use the <tt>certonly</tt>
subcommand:
<pre>$ {{base_command}} --nginx certonly</pre>

        <h4>Note:</h4>
        <p>the Nginx plugin with <tt>certonly</tt> does the following:<br>
        <ol>
          <li>make temporary config changes<br>
          (adding a new server block to pass an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-acme-acme-02#section-7.3">ACME Challenge</a>)</li>
          <li>performs a graceful reload</li>
          <li>reverts all changes</li>
          <li>performs another graceful reload</li>
        </ol>
        This appears to be a reliable process, but if you don't want Certbot
        to touch your Nginx process or files in any way, you can use the
        <a
        href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#webroot">webroot plugin</a>.
