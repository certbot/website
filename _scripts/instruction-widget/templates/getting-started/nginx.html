Certbot has an Nginx plugin, which is supported on
many platforms, and certificate installation.
</p>
{{#installer_http01}}
    <pre>$ sudo {{base_command}} --nginx</pre>
    <p>
    Running this command will get a certificate for you and have Certbot edit your Nginx configuration
    automatically to serve it. If you're feeling more conservative and would like to make the changes to your
    Nginx configuration by hand, you can use the <tt>certonly</tt>
    subcommand:
    <pre>$ sudo {{base_command}} --nginx certonly</pre>

        <aside class="note">
            <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>the Nginx plugin with <tt>certonly</tt> does the following:<br>
            <ol>
              <li>make temporary config changes<br>
              (adding a new server block to pass an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-acme-acme-02#section-7.3">ACME Challenge</a>)</li>
              <li>performs a graceful reload</li>
              <li>reverts all changes</li>
              <li>performs another graceful reload</li>
            </ol>
            This appears to be a reliable process, but if you don't want Certbot
            to touch your Nginx process or files in any way, you can use the
            <a
            href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#webroot">webroot
            plugin</a> instead.

    Due to a security issue, Let's Encrypt has stopped offering the mechanism that
    the Nginx plugin previously used to prove you control a domain. You can read
    more about this <a

    We released a new version of Certbot to work around this, but it hasn't
    been packaged by your OS yet. If you have to obtain a certificate and
    cannot wait, you have a couple of options. If you're serving files for that
    domain out of a directory on that server, you can run the following
    command:
    </p>
    <pre>$ sudo {{base_command}} --authenticator webroot --installer nginx</pre>
    <p>
    This command will get a certificate for you and have Certbot edit your
    Nginx configuration to automatically serve it. If you're
    feeling more conservative and would like to make the changes to your Nginx
    configuration by hand, you can use the <tt>certonly</tt> subcommand. To see
    instructions on how to use this subcommand, select "None of the above" in the
    first drop-down menu above.

    If you're not serving files out of a directory on the server, you can
    temporarily stop your server while you obtain the certificate; however,
    you'll have to configure Nginx to use the certificate yourself.
    The command to do this would look something like:
    </p>
    <pre>$ sudo {{base_command}} certonly --authenticator standalone --pre-hook "nginx -s stop" --post-hook "nginx"</pre>
    <p>
    If you usually use a command like <tt>systemctl</tt> or
    <tt>service</tt> to start and stop Nginx, you should use those commands
    instead in the hooks above. By using a command with hooks like this, if
    you automate renewal as described below, Certbot will automatically stop
    and start Nginx when you need to renew your certificates. If you configure
    Nginx to use the symlinks in the "live" directory as instructed by
    Certbot, Nginx will automatically begin using any renewed certificates.
