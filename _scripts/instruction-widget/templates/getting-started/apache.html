Certbot has a fairly solid beta-quality Apache plugin, which is supported on
many platforms, and automates certificate installation.
</p>
{{#installer_http01}}
    <pre>$ sudo {{base_command}} --apache</pre>
    <p>
    Running this command will get a certificate for you and have Certbot edit your Apache configuration
    automatically to serve it. If you're feeling more conservative and would like to make the changes to your
    Apache configuration by hand, you can use the <tt>certonly</tt>
    subcommand:
    <pre>$ sudo {{base_command}} --apache certonly</pre>

        <aside class="note">
            <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>the apache plugin with <tt>certonly</tt> does the following:<br>
            <ol>
              <li>make temporary config changes<br>
              (adding a new vhost to pass an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-acme-acme-02#section-7.3">ACME Challenge</a>, and enabling <tt>mod_ssl</tt> if necessary)</li>
              <li>performs a graceful reload</li>
              <li>reverts all changes</li>
              <li>performs another graceful reload</li>
            </ol>
            This appears to be a reliable process, but if you don't want Certbot
            to touch your Apache process or files in any way, you can use the
            <a
            href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#webroot">webroot plugin</a>.

    Due to a security issue, Let's Encrypt has stopped offering the mechanism that
    the Apache plugin previously used to prove you control a domain. You can read
    more about this <a

    We released a new version of Certbot to work around this, but it's not been
    packaged by your OS yet. If you have to obtain a certificate and cannot
    wait, you have a couple of options. If you're serving files for that domain
    out of a directory on that server, you can run the following command:
    </p>
    <pre>$ sudo {{base_command}} --authenticator webroot --installer apache</pre>
    <p>
    This command will get a certificate for you and have Certbot edit your
    Apache configuration to automatically serve it. If you're
    feeling more conservative and would like to make the changes to your Apache
    configuration by hand, you can use the <tt>certonly</tt> subcommand. To see
    instructions on how to use this subcommand, select "None of the above" in the
    first drop-down menu above.

    If you're not serving files out of a directory on the server, you can
    temporarily stop your server while you obtain the certificate, however,
    you'll have to configure Apache to use the certificate yourself.
    The command to do this would something look like:
    </p>
    <pre>$ sudo {{base_command}} certonly --authenticator standalone --pre-hook "apachectl -k stop" --post-hook "apachectl -k start"</pre>
    <p>
    If you usually use a command like <tt>systemctl</tt> or
    <tt>service</tt> to start and stop Apache, you should use those commands
    instead in the hooks above. By using a command with hooks like this, if
    you automate renewal as described below, Certbot will automatically stop
    and start Apache when you need to renew your certificates. If you configure
    Apache to use the symlinks in the "live" directory as instructed by
    Certbot, Apache will automatically begin using any renewed certificates.
