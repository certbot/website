<p>
Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet {{officially}} support automatic
installation {{imperative}} use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>$ sudo {{base_command}} certonly</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo {{base_command}} certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and
<tt>www.example.com</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo {{base_command}} certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com
</pre>
{{#dns_plugins}}
<p>
<strong>You can also use one of Certbot's DNS plugins to obtain a certificate if it's
installed and you have configured DNS for the domain you want to obtain a
certificate for with the DNS provider matching the plugin.</strong> To see more
information about using these plugins, click
<a href="/docs/using.html#dns-plugins">here</a>. If you want to use one of
these plugins with Let's Encrypt's new ACMEv2 server that will issue wildcard
certificates, you'll also need to include the following flag on the command
line:
</p>
<pre>
--server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
</pre>
{{/dns_plugins}}
