<p>
Certbot supports a number of different “plugins” that can be used to obtain and/or install certificates.
</p>
<p>
Since your server architecture doesn't yet {{officially}} support automatic
installation {{imperative}} use the <tt>certonly</tt> command to obtain your
certificate.
</p>
<pre>$ sudo {{base_command}} certonly</pre>
<p>
This will allow you interactively select the plugin and options used to obtain
your certificate. If you already have a webserver running, we recommend
choosing the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can specify more information on the command line.
</p>
<p>
To obtain a cert using the <a href="/docs/using.html#webroot">"webroot" plugin</a>,
which can work with the webroot directory of any webserver software:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo {{base_command}} certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /var/www/thing -d thing.is -d m.thing.is
</pre>
<p>
This command will obtain a single cert for <tt>example.com</tt>,
<tt>www.example.com</tt>, <tt>thing.is</tt>, and <tt>m.thing.is</tt>; it will
place files below <tt>/var/www/example</tt> to prove control of the first two
domains, and under <tt>/var/www/thing</tt> for the second pair.
</p>
<aside class="note">
        <h4>Note:</h4>
            <p>To use the webroot plugin, your server must be configured to serve files from hidden directories. If /.well-known is treated specially by your webserver configuration, you might need to modify the configuration to ensure that files inside /.well-known/acme-challenge are served by the webserver.</p>
</aside>
<p>
To obtain a cert using a built-in “standalone” webserver (you may need to
temporarily stop your existing webserver, if any) for <tt>example.com</tt> and
<tt>www.example.com</tt>:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo {{base_command}} certonly --standalone -d example.com -d www.example.com
</pre>
{{#dns_plugins}}
<p>
You can also use one of Certbot's DNS plugins to obtain a certificate if it's
installed and you have configured DNS for the domain you want to obtain a
certificate for with the DNS provider matching the plugin. To see more
information about using these plugins, click
<a href="/docs/using.html#dns-plugins">here</a>. If you want to use one of
these plugins with Let's Encrypt's new ACMEv2 server that will issue wildcard
certificates, you'll also need to include
<tt>--server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory</tt> on the
command line.
